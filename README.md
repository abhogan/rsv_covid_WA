# rsv_covid_WA

## Suggestions of things to explore

* Use final state as initial conditions for new run
* Consider varying transmission parameter for certain time window?
* Consider modifying underlying contact structure for certain time window? (See R/create_mixing_matrix.R to see how this was calculated from Mossong et al)
* Data summarised in WA reports but can ask if raw data available by age group and week
* Only basic outputs summarised - you can modify to plot outputs as you see fit
